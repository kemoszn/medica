*COVID-19 Medical Resource Planning and Patient's distibution tool for Hospitals &amp; Ministry of Health officials.*

This platform leverages data entered by hospitals to help ministry of health officials and works in all levels as well as hospital managers and suppliers to make intuitive decisions to manage and allocate the medical supplies of hospitals while balancing the patient's distribution to avoid overwhelming the healthcare system and flattening the curve.

**The Platform consists of three administration interfaces:**

1- The Hospital Administrator Dashboard (data source): 
Aids hospitals admins in reporting data such as COVID-19 in-patients cases (PUI, Confirmed), Acute care & ICU beds capacity, COVID-19 tests in addition to equipment supply (ventilators, masks, gloves, respirators). This data will aid ministry of health officials and suppliers to allocate the needs and medical supplies of every hospital. 

2- Officials & Suppliers Dashboard (reads from hospitals data) : 
* Lists local hospitals and plots their data entered filtered by state area.
* Display Global Statistics 

**[TODO]** Additional features include: Case prediction model, Scattered plot on map and push notifications whenever a hospital is in need of supplies. 

**Built with:** Django, ChartJS & Bootstrap
